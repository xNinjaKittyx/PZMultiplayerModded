# PZMultiplayerModded
A series of files for a vanilla, but QoL-rich server.



## Collection.py

This script simply grabs from a collection, prints out the size, date of update, and asks you for options for what mod ID to use. If exclusions are already defined, it will not ask you which mod ids you want and assume you want everything except for exclusions.

This helps me maintain my zomboid server's mod ids without having to manually do it every time.
